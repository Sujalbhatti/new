<p><b><p>Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film </p><br><br>

    <p>Arthur Fleck's a guy with lofty aspirations, wants to make you laugh and disturb your foundations, although, he's not really that funny, he ain't going to make much money, so before you start, curtail your expectations; unlike Arthur, you won't be having laughing fits, as he aspires to get some television glitz, dispatches tormentors with glee, it's a substantial, hefty fee, but I guarantee, it won't leave you in bits; although, if schadenfreude's your thing you might just chuckle, but if it's not, the story may just make you buckle, as those on, the lower rungs, tend to not have, that much fun, and quite often, from the day they learned to suckle.</p> <br><br>

    <p>It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting. To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.</b></p>
